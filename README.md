## About the Project
This project was built with the MAIN GOAL of STUDYING Typescript and Styled Components. Alongside, I was planning to also study the behavior and methods of Firebase.
As I'm still a rookie in React, this project could probably be improved in terms of performance, maybe creating custom hooks or utilizing more complex hooks already provided by React.
The Firebase part could also probably be improved, decreasing the amount of time that the database is called, providing a longer lifespan for Firebase free plan.
Since I'm not an expert on UI/UX, the layout could also be better, specially in mobile. The mobile part of the project has a lot of issues with the layout that could be improved in the long run. Probably when I get some more experience on Material Design and Styled Components the layout will be upgraded. But if you want to try to solve it by yourself, just clone the repo and give it a shot.

Despite all of those issues, that could be solved over time (and maybe with some more experience idk), I feel that I learned alot with this. From creating custom components already stylized with styled components and manipulating it with its selectors, as & for example, to creating types and interfaces with Typescript to specify props, variables, states, etc. It was a hell of a journey lol.

**THE DATABASE IS STILL LIMITED BY THE FIREBASE FREE PLAN**

## The Future

This is the first final version of InWallet, aka InWallet V1.0. The main part of the project is fully functional from the tests I performed, you can set your balance by adding transactions as incomes, you can add expenses and selecting its type, change your credit card limit to match with yours IRL, you can change your PFP, your display name, etc.

As I said before, this project was built for studying, so it will no longer be my main project and I will move on into others projects. However, I sill plan to change and improve InWallet whenever I have time. But, just as I said in the paragraph above, IT IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL and CAN be used.

So, if you still want to try it with all the problems I related in the last section, be welcome!
